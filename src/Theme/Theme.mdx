# Theme

The `<Theme>` component is a convenient way to assign a scoped theme to one or more components without impacting the global theme setting. You can also use it to wrap your entire application. You can assign the theme values `light`, `dark` and `auto` to the `theme` property of the `<Theme>` wrapper.

  <Story of={ThemeStories.Basic} />

## Theme Toggler

The `<ThemeToggler>` component provides an easy to toggle your global theme setting. The component exposes `currentColorMode` and `toggleColorMode` for full control over the toggle action.

  <Story of={ThemeStories.Toggler} />
